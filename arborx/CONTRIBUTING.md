Contributing
------------

Contributing to ArborX is easy. Just send us a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). When you send
your request, make `master` the destination branch on the [ArborX
repository](https://github.com/ArborX/ArborX). Please allow edits from
maintainers in the pull request.

Your pull request must pass ArborX's tests. It is also desired that it follows
the coding style used in ArborX (see
[wiki](https://github.com/arborx/ArborX/wiki/CodeStyle)).
